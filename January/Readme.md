# January

## Day 1

**Problem Statement:**

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## Day 2

**Problem Statement:**

Given the root of a binary tree, return a deepest node.

## Day 3

**Problem Statement:**

Given a mapping of digits to letters (as in a phone number), and a digit string, return all possible letters the number could represent. You can assume each valid number in the mapping is a single digit.

For example if {“2”: [“a”, “b”, “c”], 3: [“d”, “e”, “f”], …} then “23” should return [“ad”, “ae”, “af”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “cd”, “ce”, “cf"].

## Day 4

**Problem Statement**

Create a basic GAN model with pytorch and apply it on MNIST dataset.
This notebook is a part of Coursera GAN specialization.

## Day 5

**Problem Statement**

Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.

For example, this matrix has 4 islands:

1 0 0 0 0  
0 0 1 1 0  
0 1 1 0 0  
0 0 0 0 0  
1 1 0 0 1  
1 1 0 0 1  

## Day 6

**Problem Statement**

Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.

The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.

For example, given [(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)], you should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)].

## Day 7

**Problem Statement**


Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is eventually closed).

For example, given the string "()())()", you should return 1. Given the string ")(", you should return 2, since we must remove all of them.
